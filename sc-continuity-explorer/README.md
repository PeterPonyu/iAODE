# iAODE Continuity Explorer

Interactive web application for exploring how continuity affects trajectory structure in single-cell data.

## Features

- **Multiple Trajectory Types**: Compare linear, branching, cyclic, and discrete cluster structures
- **Embedding Methods**: Visualize data with PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE dimensionality reduction
- **Continuity Analysis**: Explore how continuity parameters affect structural preservation
- **Metrics Display**: View spectral decay, anisotropy, trajectory directionality, and more

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the explorer.

## Part of iAODE

This project is part of the [iAODE](https://github.com/PeterPonyu/iAODE) framework for interpretable single-cell omics analysis.
