## Data Requirements

Most examples use publicly available datasets from Scanpy:
- `sc.datasets.paul15()`: Mouse hematopoiesis data

For the scATAC-seq example, you'll need:
- 10X scATAC-seq H5 file
- GENCODE/Ensembl GTF annotation

Place both files in `examples/data/` before running the example. See `README.md` for verified data download links.
