# iAODE Frontend Interfaces

This branch contains the source code for the web-based user interfaces associated with the **iAODE** (Interpretable Accessibility ODE) project. It hosts two distinct applications:

1.  **`datasetsui`**: A browser for the experimental datasets used in the computational experiments.
2.  **`sc-continuity-explorer`**: A visualization tool for examining continuity metrics and monitoring the sequential refinements of the iAODE model series.

## Live Deployment

These applications are deployed and available for interactive use at:
**[https://peterponyu.github.io/iAODE](https://peterponyu.github.io/iAODE)**
